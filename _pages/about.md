The evolution of our Universe is determined by its initial conditions and the physical laws that govern it. However, neither of these are open to direct determination, but must be inferred from observations. This collaboration plans to carry out this inference using a Bayesian forward modeling approach, where we repeatedly sample a set of initial conditions, predict the observational consequences of that choice, compare to the real observations of galaxies and gas, and compute the likelihood, either explicitly or implicitly, thereby constructing the posterior distribution of the initial conditions. In practice, this is an extremely challenging endeavor because galaxy formation simulations are costly and still only incompletely understood. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the initial parameter space is enormous so standard inference techniques fail.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
